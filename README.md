* **Google API Key** (set in `.env` file as `GOOGLE_API_KEY`)

---

## ⚙️ Installation

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Install all dependencies
make install
# OR manually:
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd onecard-bot && npm install
```

### Database Setup

```bash
# Initialize and seed the database
make setup-db
# OR manually:
python3 setup_database.py
```

## 🚀 Running the Application

You have **multiple options** to run the application - choose what works best for you!

### Option 1: Shell Script (Recommended for Linux/Mac)

**Single command to start everything:**

```bash
./start.sh
```

This starts all three services in the background. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop all services.

**Features:**
- ✅ Starts all services automatically
- ✅ Logs saved to `logs/` directory
- ✅ Clean shutdown on Ctrl+C
- ✅ Color-coded output

---

### Option 2: Python Script (Cross-platform)

**Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac:**

```bash
python3 start.py
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ Process management
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on exit

---

### Option 3: Makefile Commands

**Simple commands for common tasks:**

```bash
# Start all services in background
make start-all-in-one

# Start individual services
make start-mock      # Mock API only (Port 5000)
make start-backend   # Backend only (Port 8000)
make start-frontend  # Frontend only (Port 5173)

# View logs
make logs

# Stop all services
make stop

# Clean up logs and cache
make clean

# See all available commands
make help
```

---

### Option 4: Docker Compose (Isolated Environment)

**Run everything in containers:**

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Run in background
docker-compose up -d

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

**Note:** Make sure to create a `.env` file with your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` before running.

---

### Option 5: Manual (Three Terminals) - Original Method

If you prefer to run services manually for debugging:

**Terminal 1 - Mock API:**
```bash
python3 mock_apis.py
```

**Terminal 2 - Backend:**
```bash
python3 backend.py
```

**Terminal 3 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd onecard-bot
npm run dev
```

## 🌐 Accessing the Application

Once all services are running:

* **Frontend UI:** http://localhost:5173
* **Backend API:** http://localhost:8000/docs
* **Mock API:** http://localhost:5000/docs

### Getting Started

1. **Login:** Use any customer ID (e.g., `cust_1015a13f`) and password `1234` to access the dashboard
2. **Start Chatting:** The AI assistant will help you with various credit card operations

- Verify Python and Node.js are installed
- Ensure `.env` file exists with `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

### Database errors
- Run `make setup-db` to reinitialize the database
- Check if `onecard.db` exists in the root directory

### Logs
- Check `logs/` directory for service logs
- Use `make logs` to view recent logs
- For Docker: `docker-compose logs -f`
